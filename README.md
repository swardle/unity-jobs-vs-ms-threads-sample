# Unity Job Threads vs MS Threads Sample

A test project written by Scott Wardle (scottwardle@google.com) for Google Game Development Summit 2022.
This code was written in a bit of a hurry just before the talk. But it could be useful to you if
you are trying to learn about Burst.CompileFunctionPointer or using managed code on Unity's Job threads
to resudes contension.

## How to use this project

Add this project to Unity editor. I used 2020.3.20f1 and mostly worked on stadia, or editor mode.
I would expect that android, windows or even linux players should work
